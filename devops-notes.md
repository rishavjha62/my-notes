# Markdown Notes:

## Source : Udemy

## Course: A Comprehensive Guide to the Markdown Writing Format Offering both technical examples and hands-on demos.

### Paragraph and Line Break

We can write a paragraph as normal and use double spaces to force a line break.

For example in Poem below we use `double spaces` to break at _you_. However we didn't use the double space in the 3rd
line which is causing the line break to not happen.

_If you can keep your head when all about you  
are loosing theirs, and blaming it on you,  
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
and make allowance for their doubting too,_

### Headers

Markdown supports 2 types of headers.

1.  One with equal sign under the Header 1 & dashes under the Header 2.  
    i.e.

        Header1
        =======
        Header2
        -------

2.  We can `#` to create headers.
    i.e.

# 1. Hash Symbol for H1.

## 2. Hash Symbol for H2.

###### 3. 6 Hash Sybmol for upto 6 headers.

### Showing Emphashis

- We can put Italics/Bold in two different ways.

  - For Italics : by putting the word/s between `_ _` and `* *`
    i.e.  
    In the first sentence, I will _really_, place _emphasis_ on my words in two different ways.

  - For Bold : by putting the word/s between `__ __` and `** **`
    i.e.  
    Next, I will write **very** , **strong** or bold texts, also in two different ways.

    This example will contain an_intra_word emphasis. This is a variable
    name var_example_int but Markdown will render emphasis by default.

> [!NOTE] > `*` is a safer version of the markdown as it can't be backspaced.

### Quotes

We can use quotes by putting a sing `>` sign and then starting the quote.  
i.e.

> As Nike Said,  
> Just Do it.
